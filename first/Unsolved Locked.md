##156. Binary Tree Upside Down
###题目：
Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

For example:

Given a binary tree **{1,2,3,4,5}**,

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```
return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].

```
   4
  / \
 5   2
    / \
   3   1  
```

##294. Flip Game II
###题目：
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: **+** and **-**, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive **"++"** into **"--"**. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

For example, given **s = "++++"**, return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle **"++"** to become **"+--+"**.
